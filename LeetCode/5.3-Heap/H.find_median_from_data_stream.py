    The median is the middle value in a sorted dataset.
    Example:
        - [1, <2>, 3]     --> median: 2
        - [1, 2, | 3, 4]  --> median: (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

    Approach:
        - Two-heap solution:
            - maxHeap: stores the smaller half of the numbers
            - minHeap: stores the larger half of the numbers
        - If both heaps are equal in size (even count), the median is the average of their tops.
        - Otherwise, the median is the top of the heap with more elements.

***Follow-up***
How would you optimize it:

1. If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100:
    => Use a counting array (size 101). This allows O(1) insertion
       and O(101) time to find the median by scanning through the array.

2. If 99% of the numbers are between 0 and 100:

    => Hybrid approach 1 (three arrays):
        - Use three arrays:
            - low_array: for numbers < 0
            - count_array: for 0 <= num <= 100
            - high_array: for numbers > 100
        - Since low_array and high_array are small, sorting them is cheap.
        - To find the median:
            1. Use the total count to locate the median's index.
            2. If the median is within [0, 100], you can scan the count_array directly.
               - Simply subtract the size of low_array to adjust the index.
               - No need to sort or search low/high arrays in this case.
            3. If the median lies outside the count_array range, fall back to scanning
               low_array or high_array as needed.

    => Hybrid approach 2 (array + heaps):
        - num < 0         : use a maxHeap
        - 0 <= num <= 100 : use a counting array
        - num > 100       : use a minHeap
