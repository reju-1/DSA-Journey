# Arrays and Strings

## Concepts

### Sub-array

- A **contiguous part** of an array.
- **Properties:**
  - Must be contiguous (continuous block of elements).
  - **Order is preserved.**
  - Length range: **1 to n**.
  - Total possibilities: **O(n^2)**.

### Sub-String

- A **contiguous part** of a string.
- **Properties:**
  - Similar to Sub-array.

### Sub-sequence

- A sequence derived by deleting some or no elements without changing the order.
- **Properties:**
  - Can be contiguous or non-contiguous.
  - **Order is preserved.**
  - Length range: **0 to n**.
  - Total possibilities: **2^n**.

### Sub-set

- A selection of elements from a set where order is irrelevant, and duplicates are not allowed.
- **Properties:**
  - Can be seen as a combination.
  - **Order does not matter.**
  - Length range: **0 to n**.
  - Total possibilities: **2^n**.

**Note:** The key difference between **Subset** and **Subsequence** is **Order**.  

- In a **subsequence**, **order matters**.  
- In a **subset**, **order does not matter**.
